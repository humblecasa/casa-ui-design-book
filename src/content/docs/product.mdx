# Turning this into a product/tool

A strong wedge is **Design QA + Token Enforcement for engineers**.

## MVP 1: Token linter (code)
- Flags non-token spacing/font sizes in CSS/Tailwind
- Suggests the nearest token
- Can be density-aware (compact vs comfortable)

## MVP 2: Browser extension (runtime)
- Reads computed styles in the DOM
- Flags:
  - off-grid spacing (not multiple of 4/8)
  - inconsistent type scale
  - low contrast
  - accent overuse

## MVP 3: Figma → tokens generator
- Detect spacing and type ramps in an existing Figma file
- Export:
  - CSS variables
  - Tailwind theme
  - JSON tokens

## Differentiator: “Corrections, not creativity”
Don’t try to generate a new design.
Instead, propose **token-correct** fixes:
- “18px isn’t allowed; choose 16 or 24. Based on density=comfortable: 24.”
- “This heading breaks the scale; choose 24 or 32. Choose 32 for hierarchy.”
