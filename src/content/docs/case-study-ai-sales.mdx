# Case study: AI sales research workspace

## Problem
- Reps spent too long gathering account context
- Outputs were generic and not CRM-ready

## Design decisions
- 3-pane UI: chat, account context, output templates
- Source recency tags on every fact
- “Export to CRM” action on generated notes
- Prompt chips: “Account brief”, “Competitor delta”, “Objection handling”

## UI pattern (layout + action rail)
```html
<div class="grid gap-4 xl:grid-cols-[280px_1fr_320px]">
  <aside>Template chips</aside>
  <main>Conversation + generated output</main>
  <aside>Account facts + recency</aside>
</div>
```

## Result metrics
- Research time per account: -47%
- Meeting prep quality score: +26%
- CRM note completion rate: +34%

## Why it worked
- Better context grounding
- Faster output reuse
- Less friction from chat to workflow system
