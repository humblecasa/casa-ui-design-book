# Shipping checklist (token-based UI)

Use this before you open a PR.

## Tokens
- [ ] All spacing values come from `space-*`
- [ ] Typography uses roles (`text-*`, `lh-*`), not ad-hoc sizes
- [ ] Components use the size ramp (`control-sm/md/lg`)
- [ ] Only one accent color per screen

## Layout
- [ ] Section padding is consistent (usually `48`)
- [ ] Card padding is consistent (usually `24`)
- [ ] Vertical rhythm uses a small set (`24/32/48/64`)

## Accessibility
- [ ] Focus states exist and are visible
- [ ] Text contrast is acceptable (no light-gray-on-white)
- [ ] Hit targets are at least `40px` tall for primary controls

## Consistency
- [ ] No “one-off fixes” (if you need a new value, promote it to a token)
- [ ] Similar components share identical spacing and typography
