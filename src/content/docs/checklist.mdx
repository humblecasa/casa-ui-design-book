# Ship-ready checklist

Before pushing to production, run through this checklist. It catches the issues that make UIs feel "off" but are hard to articulate.

## Spacing

- [ ] All spacing values use the token scale (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32px)
- [ ] Related elements have tighter spacing than unrelated ones
- [ ] Cards have consistent padding (typically 16px)
- [ ] Section gaps are visually clear (24-32px minimum)
- [ ] No cramped areas where elements touch or nearly touch
- [ ] Mobile has sufficient touch targets (44px minimum)

## Typography

- [ ] Maximum 3-4 font sizes per view
- [ ] Clear hierarchy: you can squint and see what's important
- [ ] Body text is 16px minimum (14px only for secondary text)
- [ ] Line height is 1.5 for body text, tighter for headings
- [ ] No orphan headings (heading followed immediately by another heading)
- [ ] Links are distinguishable without relying on color alone

## Color & Contrast

- [ ] All text passes WCAG AA contrast (4.5:1 for normal, 3:1 for large)
- [ ] Interactive elements have visible focus states
- [ ] Error states use more than just red color (icon, text, border)
- [ ] Dark mode tested (if applicable)
- [ ] Functional colors are consistent (success=green, error=red everywhere)
- [ ] Disabled states are visually distinct but not invisible

## Components

- [ ] All buttons at the same level use the same size
- [ ] Inputs and adjacent buttons have matching heights
- [ ] Icon sizes match their context (16px in small buttons, 20px in medium)
- [ ] Border radius is consistent within component families
- [ ] Loading states exist for async actions
- [ ] Empty states are designed, not just blank

## Layout

- [ ] Content doesn't touch viewport edges (minimum 16px margin on mobile)
- [ ] Max-width on text content (65-75 characters per line)
- [ ] Consistent alignment (left-aligned content, centered heroes are OK)
- [ ] Grid or flex gaps use spacing tokens
- [ ] No horizontal scroll on mobile
- [ ] Forms are single-column on mobile

## Interaction

- [ ] All interactive elements have hover states
- [ ] All interactive elements have focus states
- [ ] Click/tap targets are 44px minimum
- [ ] Buttons look clickable (don't mistake for badges or labels)
- [ ] Forms show validation errors inline, near the field
- [ ] Success feedback is visible after actions

## Responsive

- [ ] Tested at 320px width (small phones)
- [ ] Tested at 768px width (tablets)
- [ ] Tested at 1024px+ (desktop)
- [ ] Navigation works at all sizes (hamburger, collapse, etc.)
- [ ] Tables scroll horizontally or stack on mobile
- [ ] Images don't break layout at any size

## Performance visuals

- [ ] Skeleton loaders for slow content (not just spinners)
- [ ] Images have explicit dimensions (prevent layout shift)
- [ ] Above-fold content loads without flicker
- [ ] Fonts are preloaded or system fonts used
- [ ] No FOUC (flash of unstyled content)

## Polish

- [ ] Favicon is set and recognizable at small sizes
- [ ] Page titles are descriptive and unique
- [ ] 404 page is designed (not default)
- [ ] Error boundaries show user-friendly messages
- [ ] Copy is proofread (no typos, consistent terminology)
- [ ] Dates/numbers are formatted appropriately for locale

## Accessibility

- [ ] All images have alt text
- [ ] Form inputs have associated labels
- [ ] Page can be navigated with keyboard alone
- [ ] Screen reader tested (or automated a11y audit passes)
- [ ] Skip links for navigation (if header is complex)
- [ ] ARIA labels on icon-only buttons

## Quick sanity checks

**The blur test**: Blur your screen or squint. Is the hierarchy still clear?

**The thumb test**: On mobile, can you reach primary actions with your thumb?

**The no-color test**: Turn on grayscale mode. Does everything still work?

**The slow connection test**: On 3G, does the page feel usable quickly?

**The stranger test**: Would someone who's never seen this understand what to do?
