# How top tech companies actually perform design

If you want “not ugly” consistently, the pattern is the same across elite teams:

1. **Shared design system** (tokens, components, rules)
2. **Documentation as product** (not a side wiki)
3. **Design + engineering co-ownership**
4. **Accessibility and performance as default gates**
5. **Continuous iteration with real user feedback**

## 1) System first: tokens + primitives + constraints

Top teams avoid one-off styling. They define spacing, type, color, radii, motion, and component primitives up front.

- **Google Material Design 3**: strong token model and component guidance.
- **IBM Carbon**: enterprise-grade design tokens + coded components.
- **Shopify Polaris**: product UX conventions and implementation standards.

**What to copy:**
- Tokenized design decisions (not “pick any value”)
- Clear “do / don’t” examples
- Components mapped to real product use cases

- IBM Carbon: https://carbondesignsystem.com/
- Shopify Polaris: https://polaris.shopify.com/

## 2) Documentation quality is part of product quality

The best orgs treat design docs as living infrastructure.

- **Atlassian Design System**: practical usage guidance + patterns.
- **GitHub Primer**: design language tightly connected to implementation.
- **Microsoft Fluent 2**: principles, patterns, and components with clarity.

**What to copy:**
- Every component page includes anatomy, states, content guidance, accessibility, and code examples.
- Release/version notes for design system changes.
- Fast search and strong information architecture.

**Sources:**
- Atlassian Design System: https://atlassian.design/
- GitHub Primer: https://primer.style/
- Fluent 2: https://fluent2.microsoft.design/

## 3) Design-engineering partnership beats handoff culture

High-performing teams reduce “throw over the wall” behavior.

- Designers and engineers align on constraints early.
- Visual QA is part of engineering acceptance criteria.
- Product/design/engineering review together before shipping.

**What to copy:**
- Add “design acceptance checklist” to PR template.
- Require token usage (no arbitrary spacing/typography values).
- Ship screenshots/visual diffs for key UI surfaces.

## 4) Accessibility and performance are non-negotiable

Top teams treat a11y/perf as product requirements.

- **WCAG** principles applied from first draft, not patch stage.
- Performance budgets and automated checks in CI.

**What to copy:**
- Lighthouse + accessibility checks in CI (already in your pipeline).
- Color contrast checks and keyboard navigation verification.
- Guardrails for layout shift and interaction delays.

- WCAG overview (W3C): https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/
- Web.dev performance guidance: https://web.dev/performance/

## 5) Brand and craft evolve through iteration loops

Great UX is rarely one-shot. It’s shipped, measured, refined.

- Collect qualitative feedback (sessions, support, sales objections).
- Measure behavior (drop-off, conversion, retention).
- Iterate copy, hierarchy, spacing, and interaction details.

**What to copy:**
- Weekly UI polish pass.
- Monthly design debt cleanup.
- Maintain a “known rough edges” board.

## A practical standard for this site (starting now)

For every page/component update:

- **Visual**: hierarchy is obvious in 3 seconds
- **Spacing**: follows token scale only
- **Type**: no arbitrary font sizes
- **Interaction**: links/buttons have clear hover/focus states
- **Accessibility**: contrast + keyboard sanity check
- **Performance**: keep Lighthouse guardrails green

If any of these fail, we don’t call it done.
