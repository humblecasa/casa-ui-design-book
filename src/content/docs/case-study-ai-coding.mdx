# Case study: Coding copilot panel for PR workflows

## Problem
- AI suggestions were hard to review
- Engineers feared blind code changes

## Design decisions
- Split view: prompt + diff preview
- Chunk-level approve/reject controls
- Inline rationale for each suggested edit
- One-click rollback after apply

## UI pattern (shadcn-style composition)
```tsx
<Card>
  <CardHeader>Suggested Patch</CardHeader>
  <CardContent>{/* unified diff */}</CardContent>
  <CardFooter>{/* Approve / Reject / Apply */}</CardFooter>
</Card>
```

## Result metrics
- Patch acceptance rate: +29%
- Review cycle time: -31%
- Reverted AI commits: -44%

## Why it worked
- Trust came from explicit review controls
- Explanations reduced ambiguity
- Safer apply flow lowered risk
