# Pre-coding workflow

The worst time to make design decisions is while you're coding. You're in implementation mode, not design mode. Decisions get made by accident. Inconsistencies creep in.

This workflow front-loads the thinking so coding becomes execution.

## The 4-step process

### Step 1: Content inventory (10 min)

Before touching layout, list everything that needs to be on the screen:

**Example: User profile page**
```
- Avatar (editable)
- Display name
- Email (verified badge)
- Bio (optional, 160 char max)
- Join date
- Plan type (Free/Pro/Team)
- Usage stats (3 metrics)
- Edit button
- Upgrade CTA (if Free)
- Danger zone (delete account)
```

No hierarchy yet. Just what exists.

**Why this matters**: You can't design what you haven't defined. Missing elements surface here, not during code review.

### Step 2: Hierarchy mapping (10 min)

Rank by importance (1 = most important):

```
1. Display name, avatar (identity)
2. Plan type, usage stats (status)
3. Email, bio (details)
4. Edit, upgrade (actions)
5. Join date (metadata)
6. Delete account (rare, dangerous)
```

Now assign visual weight:
- Level 1-2: Large, prominent
- Level 3-4: Normal, clear
- Level 5-6: Small, subtle

**Why this matters**: Hierarchy prevents "everything is equally important" layouts. Users know where to look.

### Step 3: Token selection (15 min)

Map each element to design tokens:

| Element | Typography | Spacing | Color |
|---------|------------|---------|-------|
| Display name | `--text-2xl`, semibold | `--space-2` below | `--color-text` |
| Avatar | 64px | `--space-4` right | - |
| Plan badge | `--text-xs`, medium | `--space-1` padding | Primary for Pro |
| Section gap | - | `--space-8` | - |
| Danger zone | `--text-sm` | `--space-6` top | Error color |

Every choice references a token. No magic numbers.

**Why this matters**: Consistency is automatic when you use the same tokens everywhere.

### Step 4: State documentation (10 min)

List all possible states:

**Loading**
- Skeleton for avatar, name, stats
- Disabled edit button

**Empty states**
- No bio: "Add a bio to tell people about yourself"
- No usage: "Start using the product to see stats"

**Error states**
- Avatar upload failed: inline error + retry
- Save failed: toast + retry button

**Edge cases**
- Very long name: truncate with ellipsis
- Missing email verification: warning banner

**Why this matters**: States that aren't designed become bugs. Document them upfront.

## Putting it together

Your pre-coding artifact should look like this:

```markdown
# Profile Page - Design Spec

## Content
- Avatar (64px, editable)
- Display name (--text-2xl)
- Email + verified badge
- Bio (--text-base, muted if empty)
- Plan badge (Pro = primary color)
- Stats: 3 cards, --space-4 gap
- Actions: Edit (secondary), Upgrade (primary)
- Danger zone: --space-8 separation

## States
- Loading: skeleton loader
- Empty bio: placeholder CTA
- Free plan: show upgrade CTA
- Pro plan: hide upgrade CTA

## Mobile adaptations
- Stats stack vertically
- Avatar shrinks to 48px
- Danger zone in collapsible
```

This becomes your checklist during implementation.

## Time investment

| Step | Time | Output |
|------|------|--------|
| Content inventory | 10 min | Complete element list |
| Hierarchy mapping | 10 min | Priority ranking |
| Token selection | 15 min | Token-to-element mapping |
| State documentation | 10 min | All states listed |
| **Total** | **45 min** | Complete design spec |

45 minutes of planning saves hours of "hmm, what size should this be?" and rework.

## Common shortcuts (and why they fail)

❌ **"I'll figure it out while coding"**  
Result: Inconsistent spacing, missed states, rework

❌ **"The design is in my head"**  
Result: Details forgotten, different interpretation by others

❌ **"Let's just use what we did last time"**  
Result: Copy-paste without thinking, doesn't fit new context

❌ **"We don't have time for this"**  
Result: Spend 3x the time fixing issues later

## When to skip this

You can abbreviate the process for:
- **Tiny changes**: Single button text change
- **Exact replication**: Copying an existing component verbatim
- **Prototypes**: Throwaway explorations

But for any new screen or significant feature, do the work.

## Template

Copy this for every new screen:

```markdown
# [Screen Name] - Design Spec

## Content inventory
- 

## Hierarchy (1=highest)
1. 
2. 
3. 

## Token mapping
| Element | Typography | Spacing | Color |

## States
- Loading:
- Empty:
- Error:
- Edge cases:

## Mobile adaptations
- 
```

Fill it in before opening your code editor. Your future self will thank you.
