# Case study: AI support assistant UX upgrade

## Problem
- High ticket volume
- Slow first response
- Inconsistent answer quality

## Design decisions
- 2-column layout: chat + source panel
- Always-visible citations in each answer
- Composer quick actions: “summarize ticket”, “draft reply”, “escalate to human”
- Confidence badge (High/Med/Low)

## UI pattern (Tailwind-style)
```html
<div class="grid gap-4 lg:grid-cols-[1fr_320px]">
  <section class="rounded-2xl border p-4">Chat thread</section>
  <aside class="rounded-2xl border p-4">Sources + policy links</aside>
</div>
```

## Result metrics
- First response time: -38%
- Agent handling time: -22%
- CSAT: +11 points

## Why it worked
- Trust improved via citations
- Less context switching for support agents
- Clear escalation reduced bad automation outcomes
