# Case study: AI support assistant

**Goal**: Replace the wall of FAQ text with a conversational interface that answers product questions, cites sources, and knows when to escalate.

## The challenge

Support teams drown in repetitive questions. Users hate searching through docs. The solution seems obvious: AI chatbot. But most AI support bots feel like talking to a brick wall with a language model behind it.

The difference between "helpful assistant" and "annoying chatbot" comes down to UI decisions.

## Layout structure

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Header: Product logo + "Support" + Status │
├───────────────────────┬────────────────────┤
│                       │                    │
│   Conversation        │   Source Panel     │
│   Thread              │   (collapsed on    │
│                       │    mobile)         │
│                       │                    │
├───────────────────────┴────────────────────┤
│  Composer: Input + Attach + Send           │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Desktop**: 60/40 split between chat and sources  
**Mobile**: Full-width chat, sources slide up on tap

## Critical UI elements

### 1. Message bubbles with citations
Every factual claim needs a source link:

```html
<div class="message assistant">
  <p>Your subscription renews on the 15th of each month. 
     <a class="citation" href="#billing-docs">Source: Billing FAQ</a>
  </p>
</div>
```

Why: Users need to verify. If they can't check the source, they'll ask a human anyway.

### 2. Confidence indicators
Not all answers are equal:

```html
<div class="confidence high">
  <span class="badge">High confidence</span>
  <p>Based on 3 documentation matches</p>
</div>

<div class="confidence low">
  <span class="badge">Best effort</span>
  <p>No exact match found. This may not be accurate.</p>
</div>
```

### 3. Escalation paths
Always provide an out:

```html
<div class="escalation-prompt">
  <p>Would you like to:</p>
  <button>Talk to a human</button>
  <button>Create a ticket</button>
  <button>Schedule a call</button>
</div>
```

Show this after 2-3 exchanges that don't resolve the issue.

### 4. Suggested follow-ups
Reduce user effort:

```html
<div class="suggestions">
  <button class="chip">How do I cancel?</button>
  <button class="chip">Can I get a refund?</button>
  <button class="chip">Change payment method</button>
</div>
```

## Token application

| Element | Spacing | Typography | Notes |
|---------|---------|------------|-------|
| Message gap | `--space-4` (16px) | - | Between messages |
| Message padding | `--space-3` (12px) | - | Inside bubble |
| Body text | - | `--text-base` | 16px |
| Citations | - | `--text-sm` | 14px, muted color |
| Suggestions | `--space-2` gap | `--text-sm` | Chip buttons |

## Interaction patterns

### Typing indicator
Show something alive:
```html
<div class="typing-indicator">
  <span>●</span><span>●</span><span>●</span>
</div>
```

### Streaming responses
Don't wait for complete response—stream tokens as they arrive. Feels faster even if total time is the same.

### Error handling
```html
<div class="error-state">
  <p>I couldn't process that request.</p>
  <button>Try again</button>
  <button>Talk to support</button>
</div>
```

Never dead-end the user.

## Metrics that matter

- **Resolution rate**: Did they stop asking questions?
- **Escalation rate**: How often do they bail to human?
- **Citation click rate**: Are they verifying? (Good if moderate, bad if constant)
- **Retry rate**: Are they rephrasing? (Indicates confusion)

## Common mistakes

❌ **No sources**: "Trust me, I'm AI"  
✅ **Citations on every fact**: Let users verify

❌ **Infinite loop**: Bot keeps failing, user keeps trying  
✅ **Escalation path**: Offer human help after 2-3 failures

❌ **Generic responses**: "I'm here to help!"  
✅ **Specific actions**: "Click Settings → Billing to update"

❌ **Hidden limitations**: User finds out the hard way  
✅ **Upfront clarity**: "I can help with billing and account questions"

## What good looks like

1. User asks question
2. Assistant answers with inline citations
3. Source panel highlights relevant docs
4. Follow-up suggestions appear
5. If unresolved after 2 turns, escalation prompt shows
6. Human handoff is seamless (context preserved)

The AI isn't replacing support—it's the first line of defense that handles the easy 80% so humans can focus on the hard 20%.
