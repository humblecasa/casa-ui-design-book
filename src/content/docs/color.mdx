# Color tokens (60–30–10, but operational)

Treat color as **intent**.

## Core roles
- `bg`, `surface`, `surface-2`
- `text`, `text-muted`
- `border`
- `primary`, `on-primary`
- `success`, `warning`, `danger`

## Practical 60–30–10
- **60%**: neutral backgrounds/surfaces
- **30%**: text + borders + secondary chrome
- **10%**: accent (primary buttons/links/highlights)

## Rules
- One accent hue per screen.
- Neutrals do most of the work.
- Add states (hover/focus/disabled) as tokens, not ad-hoc values.
